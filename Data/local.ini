173.6="If I'm not mistaken, one of the main purposes of these rooms was to stop SCP-173 from moving further in the event of a containment breach. So, who's brilliant idea was it to put A GODDAMN MAN-SIZED VENTILATION DUCT in there?"
173.default=%s. Cause of death: Fatal cervical fracture. Assumed to be attacked by SCP-173.
106.dimension=%s. Body partially decomposed by what is assumed to be SCP-106's "corrosion" effect. Body disposed of via incineration.

895.offices="One (1) large and highly active tentacle-like appendage seems to have grown outside the dead body of a scientist within office area [DATA REDACTED]. It's level of aggression is unlike anything we've seen before - it looks like it has beaten some unfortunate Class D to death at some point during the breach."
895.default="We will need more than the regular cleaning team to take care of this. Two (2) large and highly active tentacle-like appendages seem to have formed inside the chamber. Their level of aggression is unlike anything we've seen before - it looks like they have beaten some unfortunate Class D to death at some point during the breach."
939="All four (4) escaped SCP-939 specimens have been captured and recontained successfully. They made quite a mess at Storage Area 6. A cleaning team has been dispatched."
1499.dimension=All personnel situated within Evacuation Shelter LC-2 during the breach have been administered Class-B amnestics due to Incident 1499-E. The Class D subject involved in the event died shortly after being shot by Agent [DATA REDACTED].

ntf.terminated=%s. Terminated by Nine-Tailed Fox.
ntf.gatea="%s was spotted in Gate A area and terminated. Incident needs an investigation."
895="What we know is that he died of cardiac arrest. My guess is that it was caused by SCP-895, although it has never been observed affecting video equipment from this far before. Further testing is needed to determine whether SCP-895's 'Red Zone' is increasing."
895.nvg.914="Class D viewed SCP-895 through a pair of digital night vision goggles, presumably enhanced by SCP-914. It might be possible that the subject was able to resist the memetic effects partially through these goggles. The goggles have been stored for further study."
895.nvg.096="Class D viewed SCP-895 through an apparatus called 'SCRAMBLE Gear', killing him."
895.nvg="Class D viewed SCP-895 through a pair of digital night vision goggles, killing him."

914="A heavily mutilated corpse found inside the output booth of SCP-914. DNA testing identified the corpse as Class D %s. The subject had obviously been 'refined' by SCP-914 on the 'Rough' setting, but we are still confused as to how he ended up inside the intake booth and who or what wound the key."
1048a=A dead body covered in ears was found in [DATA REDACTED]. Subject was presumably attacked by an instance of SCP-1048-A and suffocated to death by the ears. Body was sent for autopsy.
1162=A dead Class D subject was discovered within the containment chamber of SCP-1162-ARC. An autopsy revealed that his right lung was missing, which suggests interaction with SCP-1162-ARC.

superman=A Class D jumpsuit found in [DATA REDACTED]. Upon further examination, the jumpsuit was found to be filled with 12.5 kilograms of blue ash-like substance. Chemical analysis of the substance remains non-conclusive. Most likely related to SCP-914.
joint=%s found in a comatose state in [DATA REDACTED]. The subject was holding what appears to be a cigarette while smiling widely. Chemical analysis of the cigarette has been inconclusive, although it seems to contain a high concentration of an unidentified chemical whose molecular structure is remarkably similar to that of tetrahydrocannabinol.
morepower="Requesting support from MTF Nu-7. We need more firepower to take this thing down."

[tooltip]
cantchange=This option cannot be changed in-game.
fullscreen=This option only takes effect in fullscreen.
bump="Bump mapping" is used to simulate bumps and dents by distorting the lightmaps.
vsync="Vertical sync" waits for the display to finish its current refresh cycle before calculating the next frame, preventing issues such as screen tearing. This ties the game's frame rate to your display's refresh rate and may cause some input lag.
alias="Anti-Aliasing" is used to smooth the rendered image before displaying in order to reduce aliasing around the edges of models.
lights=Toggles the artificial lens flare effect generated over light sources.
gamma="Gamma correction" is used to achieve a good brightness factor to balance out your display's gamma if the game appears either too dark or bright. Setting it too high or low can cause the graphics to look less detailed.
default.value.100=Current value: %s% (default is 100%)
particle_1=Determines the amount of particles that can be rendered per tick.
particle_2.1=Only smoke emitters will produce particles.
particle_2.2=Only a few particles will be rendered per tick.
particle_2.3=All particles are rendered.
lod="Texture LOD Bias" affects the distance at which texture detail will change to prevent aliasing. Change this option if textures flicker or look too blurry.
vram=Textures that are stored in the Video-RAM will load faster, but this also has negative effects on the texture quality as well.
fov="Field of view" is the amount of game view that is on display during a game.
default.value.fov=Current value: %s° (default is 60°)
anisotropic="Anisotropic filtering" enhances the image quality of textures on surfaces that are at oblique viewing angles with respect to the camera.
atmo=Changes the atmosphere to dark or bright. The bright atmosphere is more comfortable to play in a daylight and better for making a video. In turn, the dark one is better for a night playing.
mastervolume=Adjusts the master volume of sounds. Sliding the bar fully to the left will mute all sounds.
default.value.50=Current value: %s% (default is 50%)
default.value.0=Current value: %s% (default is 0%)
musicvolume=Adjusts the volume of background music. Sliding the bar fully to the left will mute all music.
soundvolume=Adjusts the volume of sound effects. Sliding the bar fully to the left will mute all environment sounds.
autorelease="Sound auto-release" will free a sound from memory if it not used after 5 seconds. Prevents memory allocation issues.
usertrack=Toggles the ability to play custom tracks over channel 1 of the radio. These tracks are loaded from the "SFX\Radio\UserTracks\" directory. Press "1" when the radio is selected to change track.
trackmode=Sets the playing mode for the custom tracks. "Repeat" plays every file in alphabetical order. "Random" chooses the next track at random.
modenote=Note that the random mode doesn't prevent previously played tracks from repeating.
scantrack=Re-checks the user tracks directory for any new or removed sound files.
cantchangebtn=This button cannot be used in-game.
mousespeed=Adjusts the speed of the mouse pointer.
invertx="Invert mouse X-axis" is self-explanatory.
inverty="Invert mouse Y-axis" is self-explanatory.
mousesmooth=Adjusts the amount of smoothing of the mouse pointer.
configcontrol=Configure the in-game control scheme.
hud=Displays the blink and stamina meters.
console=Toggles the use of the developer console. Can be used in-game by pressing %s.
errorconsole="Open console on error" is self-explanatory.
achipop=Displays a pop-up notification when an achievement is unlocked.
autosave=Automatically saves the game every 2 minutes. Press "%s" to cancel auto save.
autosave.note=This option only works with "Save anywhere" save type.
fps=Displays the frames per second counter at the top left-hand corner.
frame=Limits the frame rate that the game can run at to a desired value.
frame.note=Usually, 60 FPS or higher is preferred. If you are noticing excessive stuttering at this setting, try lowering it to make your framerate more consistent.
bar=Makes the bars moving smoother.
startvideo="Startup videos" plays startup videos while opening the game.
launcher="Use launcher" is self-explanatory.
subtitles=Displays current dialogs in the text form. Currently unfinished and unstable. Not recommened to use!
subtitles.color="Subtitles color" is self-explanatory.
reset="Reset options" is self-explanatory.
