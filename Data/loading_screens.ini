Desc2=SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections.
Desc3=However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue.

Desc2=Subject is capable of moving of its own accord, and can communicate through a small range of gestures. The subject regularly shows affection to individuals in ways found endearing by most people.
Desc3=Affection is usually given in the form of a hug to the lower leg, but subject has also been observed dancing, jumping in place, and in two separate events it has even drawn child-like pictures for personnel.
Desc4=SCP-1048 uses its endearing qualities to lull those around it in to a false sense of security, allowing it to collect materials to produce these creations.
